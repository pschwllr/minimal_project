Just a short project test

## 🔥 Usage

> TODO show in a very small amount of space the **MOST** useful thing your package can do.
> Make it as short as possible! You have an entire set of docs for later.

## 👩‍💻 Installation

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n ch200 python=3.10 
```

```
conda activate ch200
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(ch200) $ pip install jupyterlab
```


## 🛠️ Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:pschwllr/ch200`.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:pschwllr/ch200.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual.
